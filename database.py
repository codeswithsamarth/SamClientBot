database.py

Engine / session configuration for TiDB Cloud (MySQL wire protocol,
via PyMySQL) using SQLAlchemy 2.x.

Notes on the choices below, since they're easy to get subtly wrong
against TiDB specifically:

- SQLAlchemy 2.0 has no `future=` flag anymore — "future style" is
  the only style, so there's nothing to opt into. (Passing future=
  to create_engine() on 2.0 is not needed and is not used here.)

- `expire_on_commit=False` is required for this project: handlers
  read attributes off ORM objects (order.id, user.balance, etc.)
  *after* db.commit() inside the same request, often after the
  session has already been closed in a `finally:` block. With the
  default `expire_on_commit=True`, that first attribute access after
  commit would silently try to re-run a SELECT on a closed session
  and raise.

- TiDB defaults to pessimistic transactions since TiDB 5.0, but that
  is a *cluster-level* default (`tidb_txn_mode`) that can be
  overridden per-session. `with_for_update()` (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE)
  only actually blocks other transactions under pessimistic mode. If
  this cluster (or a future one this bot is pointed at) ever has
  `tidb_txn_mode = 'optimistic'` as its default, `with_for_update()`
  would silently become a no-op instead of a real lock — no error,
  just no locking. We remove that ambiguity entirely by setting
  `tidb_txn_mode = 'pessimistic'` explicitly on every new connection
  in `_set_tidb_session_options` below, instead of trusting the
  cluster default.

- Even with real pessimistic locks, TiDB can still raise a write
  conflict (error 9007, "Write conflict") when two pessimistic
  transactions genuinely collide, or a "Table 'x' doesn't exist" style
  transient error after a schema change propagates across the
  cluster. The right response to error 9007 specifically is "retry the
  whole transaction" — it is not a bug, it's TiDB telling you to try
  again. `run_with_retry()` / the `@retry_on_write_conflict` decorator
  below exist for exactly this.
